# Correctness proof implementation progress

This records implemented evidence against [CORRECTNESS_PLAN.md](CORRECTNESS_PLAN.md).
It is not a completion certificate. No full-correctness milestone is closed yet.

## Source accounting (M0, C01–C12, P12)

- `coverage.json` reviews 184 syntactic items in Jarl's production module tree.
- Provium independently regenerates file/item hashes and unresolved call spellings.
  Jarl's ordinary tests reject stale sources or missing classifications.
- New fields, variants, methods and late effects invalidate the review. Exact
  `cfg(test)` modules are recorded but not traversed; other cfg is conservatively
  inventoried. Calls, trait resolution, macro expansion and Cargo closure remain open.
- Component-evidence labels do not constitute verification. The complete gate
  cannot pass by editing labels and currently rejects every full-proof claim.
- `builds.json` selects the host profile for offline Cargo accounting. An ordinary
  integration test records normal/build dependencies, manifest/lock hashes,
  features, target declarations and rustc/cfg identity, and ensures proof tools
  remain outside Jarl's dependency-free runtime graph. Expanded source,
  effective compiler commands and ambient Cargo configuration remain open.

## Complete input-gating queries (M1/M5, C07, R08/R11)

- Provium now translates complete shared Result queries with bool, Option and
  optional-array reads, source-resolved unit error variants, and inlined shared
  helper calls. It rejects hidden effects, unresolved constructors, recursion,
  shadowed types and excessive expansion.
- Jarl's `Node::available` and `Node::idle` have exact-result, blocking and
  clean-admission contracts over arbitrary outbox lengths.
- A composed contract links generated `Ready::persisted` effects to the generated
  input gate: acknowledgment clears dirty state but preserves output backpressure.
- These checks run for the host and installed wasm32 target. Method manifests now
  record verbose rustc identity, target cfg and exact direct type-check arguments.
- Three independent source mutations remove the gate conditions individually;
  each must fail in Lean's invariant proof after successful Rust translation.
- An independent provider fixture compares the IR to native Rust across every
  dirty/reply/optional-array combination at capacities zero through four, and has
  its own kernel-checked contract and negative control.

## Capacity predicates (M1, C02/R02)

- Shared scalar methods now retain original impl const parameters and builtin
  field types, including target-sized usize. Their complete bodies retain scalar
  faults and local computation.
- `State::full` is translated directly from Jarl and proved equal to the capacity
  comparison. Given the separate `len ≤ CAP` invariant, non-full implies space.
- The contract passes for 64-bit and installed wasm32 targets. Changing the
  original equality to inequality must fail the Lean contract, not the parser.
- Establishing `len ≤ CAP` through construction, restore and every mutation is
  still open; this predicate proof does not assume those callers are correct.

## Outstanding dependency frontier

The source inventory is not a resolved call closure or Cargo build proof. Query
and assignment stores still require Rust type/layout/borrow refinement. The
gate-view relation is explicit proof specification, not a verified Rust memory
model. No current contract proves all gate callers correct or that a host's save
was durable. Global election safety, log matching, leader completeness,
configuration-history safety, recovery composition and conditional liveness
remain open. Existing component proofs and bounded tests do not close them.

The next implementation work is P01–P07/P10: resolve complete source/type/call
dependencies and extend outcome semantics through state, election and persistence
transitions. M2 requires an inductive historical election theorem over those
complete generated transitions, including durable votes and restart.
